# Key Exchange Algoritms, a way of defining a shared key that will be used by the ciphers to encrypt the session between
# 2 peers. a good algorithm prevents MITM, or guessing the session key.
# Remove the file /etc/ssh/moduli because diffie-hellman algorithms are not used.

# Disables the ability to use passwords for authentication which prevents brute force attacks, rainbow tables, and completley

PasswordAuthentication no

# In case password authentication is permitted then its recommended to explicitly disable empty password authentication
# this type of authentication does no authenticate users

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Disables the ability to authenticate as the root user, recommended to use this user locally only and in emergancy scenarios

PermitRootLogin no

# Enables to authenticate users with private/public keys, recommended to use and avoid using passwords

PubkeyAuthentication yes

# This param gives you the ability to specify which authentication methods you want your system to supported

AuthenticationMethods publickey
