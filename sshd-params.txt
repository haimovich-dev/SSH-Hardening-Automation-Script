# ========================================================================

# Disables the ability to use passwords for authentication which prevents brute force attacks, rainbow tables, and completley
# removes an entire attack surface related to passwords.

PasswordAuthentication no

# In case password authentication is permitted then its recommended to explicitly disable empty password authentication
# this type of authentication does no authenticate users

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Disables the ability to authenticate as the root user, recommended to use this user locally only and in emergancy scenarios

PermitRootLogin no

# Enables to authenticate users with private/public keys, recommended to use and avoid using passwords

PubkeyAuthentication yes

# This param gives you the ability to specify which authentication methods you want your system to supported

AuthenticationMethods publickey

# Specifies if host based authentication is allowed on the server, explicilty set to no

# ========================================================================

# Allows using SSH to forward X11 traffic, the X11 traffic is wrapped in SSH tunnel, disable this option explicitly 
# to avoid unnecessary connections and traffic.

X11Forwarding no

# Allows to forward ssh agent socket to use private keys remotely, if enabled allows to use the server as an
# intermediate server without exposing private keys, usefull only if the server is ment to be used as an
# intermediate server.

AllowAgentForwarding no

# Allows using the SSH Daemon as a local/remote/dynamic proxy server for TCP traffic, usefull only in case the 
# SSH server is planned to be used as a proxy server. form security perspective recommended to completley 
# disable the feature.

AllowTcpForwarding no

# Very simmilar to TCP forwarding, but refers to UNIX domain sockets represented as files. every socket file is locally
# stored somewhere in the filesystem and belongs to some daemon which offer services. forwarding this type of sockets
# allows users to interact with local sockets.

AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# A single parameter that disable every forwarding parameter stated above, including ssh-agent/TCP/stream/x11.

#                    GSSAPI + Kerberos SECTION
# ========================================================================

# Another form of providing SSH authentication, uses a seperate authentication method, for example Kerberos,
# provides an SSO by using TGT cache in case kerberos is used. can also be used with other authentication
# systems, mostly usable in domain environments, enable only if needed.

GSSAPIAuthentication no

# Relevant if GSSAPIAuthentication is set ot yes, on logout clears user credential data

GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# Checks for hostname when authenticating to a server, for exmpale if user authenticates to S1.domain.com
# the tockets name must be S1.domain.com. if set to no then authentication can happen on another machine
# set to yse in order to avoid interception, enable only if required.

GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck yes

# Enables Kerberos passwrod verification, when user authenticates to the SSH server, the SSH daemon would request
# validation from the KDC to confirm the user password. works onlu if PasswordAuthentication is set to yes

KerberosAuthentication no

# Deprecated technology, if the SSH host has AFS and KerberosGetAFSToken set to yes, then gets access to the AFS
# which is not used, set to no to shrink attack vector.

KerberosGetAFSToken no

# If Kerberos password verification by KDC fails, the check the password with another authentication programm, in
# case Kerberos explicitly was configured to be used as user authentication system, then disable other authentication
# methods.

KerberosOrLocalPasswd no

# If Kerberos is used for user authenticity then on logout destroy any cache that contains user credenntial in it.
