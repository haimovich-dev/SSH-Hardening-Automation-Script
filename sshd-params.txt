PasswordAuthentication no

# In case password authentication is permitted then its recommended to explicitly disable empty password authentication
# this type of authentication does no authenticate users

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Disables the ability to authenticate as the root user, recommended to use this user locally only and in emergancy scenarios

PermitRootLogin no

# Enables to authenticate users with private/public keys, recommended to use and avoid using passwords

PubkeyAuthentication yes
