# ========================================================================

# Disables the ability to use passwords for authentication which prevents brute force attacks, rainbow tables, and completley

PasswordAuthentication no

# In case password authentication is permitted then its recommended to explicitly disable empty password authentication
# this type of authentication does no authenticate users

PermitEmptyPasswords no

# Disables the ability to authenticate as the root user, recommended to use this user locally only and in emergancy scenarios

PermitRootLogin no

# Enables to authenticate users with private/public keys, recommended to use and avoid using passwords

PubkeyAuthentication yes

# This param gives you the ability to specify which authentication methods you want your system to supported

AuthenticationMethods publickey

# Specifies if host based authentication is allowed on the server, explicilty set to no

HostbasedAuthentication no

# An option that allows a sort of 2FA by requiring users to physically authenticate them selves, avaliable only if the FIDO library is 
# integrated into OpenSSH, the possible values are touch-requried/verify-required. relevant only for environments that use SK algorithms
# for user authentication.

# In case the X11 forwarding is enabled, this param states which address should be binded to the x11 server.

# ========================================================================

# Allows using SSH to forward X11 traffic, the X11 traffic is wrapped in SSH tunnel, disable this option explicitly 
# to avoid unnecessary connections and traffic.

X11Forwarding no

# Allows to forward ssh agent socket to use private keys remotely, if enabled allows to use the server as an
# intermediate server without exposing private keys, usefull only if the server is ment to be used as an
# intermediate server.

AllowAgentForwarding no

# Allows using the SSH Daemon as a local/remote/dynamic proxy server for TCP traffic, usefull only in case the 
# SSH server is planned to be used as a proxy server. form security perspective recommended to completley 
# disable the feature.

AllowTcpForwarding no

# Very simmilar to TCP forwarding, but refers to UNIX domain sockets represented as files. every socket file is locally
# stored somewhere in the filesystem and belongs to some daemon which offer services. forwarding this type of sockets
# allows users to interact with local sockets.

AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# A single parameter that disable every forwarding parameter stated above, including ssh-agent/TCP/stream/x11.

DisableForwarding yes

#                    GSSAPI + Kerberos SECTION
# ========================================================================

# Another form of providing SSH authentication, uses a seperate authentication method, for example Kerberos,
# provides an SSO by using TGT cache in case kerberos is used. can also be used with other authentication
# systems, mostly usable in domain environments, enable only if needed.

GSSAPIAuthentication no

# Relevant if GSSAPIAuthentication is set ot yes, on logout clears user credential data

GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

# Checks for hostname when authenticating to a server, for exmpale if user authenticates to S1.domain.com
# the tockets name must be S1.domain.com. if set to no then authentication can happen on another machine
# set to yse in order to avoid interception, enable only if required.

GSSAPIStrictAcceptorCheck yes

# Enables Kerberos passwrod verification, when user authenticates to the SSH server, the SSH daemon would request
# validation from the KDC to confirm the user password. works onlu if PasswordAuthentication is set to yes

KerberosAuthentication no

# Deprecated technology, if the SSH host has AFS and KerberosGetAFSToken set to yes, then gets access to the AFS
# which is not used, set to no to shrink attack vector.

KerberosGetAFSToken no

# If Kerberos password verification by KDC fails, the check the password with another authentication programm, in
# case Kerberos explicitly was configured to be used as user authentication system, then disable other authentication
# methods.

KerberosOrLocalPasswd no

# If Kerberos is used for user authenticity then on logout destroy any cache that contains user credenntial in it.

# As part of the SSH protocol standards, the initial negotiation contains the protocol version and the software version in a 
# form of <SSH-version-software comment> for example "SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_9.6p1 Ubuntu-3ubuntu13.14" is the default 
# SSH protocol version exchange banner on Ubuntu distributions, unfortunately you can't change the comment section which reveals 
# the local distribution on a default build because its embedded into sshd binary. This is a security flaw that allows the 
# attacker to get the distro thats being used by the server. explicitly specify none to avoid any information to be revealed

VersionAddendum none

# When login prompt is sent, the banner is   nformative data. avoid information fingerprinting

Banner none

# Relevant only if the build included zlib which is responsible for traffic compression, in case OpenSSH suppots compression its recommended to 
# set to 'no' because there are known attack vectors on compressed encrypted SSL traffic, in theory possible with SSH traffic.
# use only in internal networks if needed.

Compression no

# Specifies if sshd should accept IPv4/IPv6/Both traffic, recommended to limit the parameter to the relevant traffic

AddressFamily inet 

# Does not impact security at all, displays a text after the user logs into the system. In case an unauthorized user got access to the system
# may reveal information if set in /etc/motd so be carefull what you put there. 

PrintMotd no

# Just prints the last time the logged user had logged previously, may be usefull to spot an unwanted access. 

PrintLastLog yes

# Sets the SSH_USER_AUTH variable in the environment of the shell session that contains the path to a file that contians auth methods
# as stated previously as less information you reveal the less a possible attacker can know.

ExposeAuthInfo no

# Specifies the location of the .pid file which stores the sshd process number, this number can be used by other programms that interact with the sshd process
# it does not impact the system from security perspective. 

PidFile /var/run/sshd.pid

# There is a standard in the community to change the default port number, thi tactic does noe impact security in any possible way, only requires additional small amount of time
# to discover the custom port. but adds complications in the form of explicitly spesifying the custom port whenever its beign used.
